# Github
- Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development.

# Git Commands
1. git clone <repository-url> -->	Creates a local copy of a remote repository on your machine.
2. git add <file>	--> Stages changes in a file, preparing it to be committed.
3. git commit -m "message" -->	Saves the staged changes to the local repository with a descriptive message.
 (we have to write a message to  commit changes)
4. git push origin <branch> -->	Uploads local commits to the remote repository (e.g., GitHub).
5. 

# Github Webhooks
- We can use webhooks to trigger jenkins pipeline i.e. when we make any commit in the git repo automatically the pipeline will be trigered.
- we cando this by :
  1) go to git repo we want to automate.
  2) go to settings.
  3) go to webhooks.
  4) add new webhook.
    in webhook add the site of our jenkins server. eg. http://server_ip:8080/github-webhook/
  5) check if the webhook is sending data or not by checking 'Recent deliveries' in webhook.
