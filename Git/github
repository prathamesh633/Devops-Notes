# Github Webhooks
- We can use webhooks to trigger jenkins pipeline i.e. when we make any commit in the git repo automatically the pipeline will be trigered.
- we cando this by :
  1) go to git repo we want to automate.
  2) go to settings.
  3) go to webhooks.
  4) add new webhook.
    in webhook add the site of our jenkins server. eg. http://server_ip:8080/github-webhook/
  5) check if the webhook is sending data or not by checking 'Recent deliveries' in webhook.
