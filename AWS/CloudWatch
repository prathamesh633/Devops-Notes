# CloudWatch
- A monitoring and observability service that collects:
  Metrics (numbers like CPU usage)
  Logs (text data from apps)
  Events (system changes)
  Alarms (notifications when things go wrong)

# Components of CloudWatch
1) CloudWatch Metrics
- Numeric data about AWS services (updated every minute)
- Examples:
 EC2 CPU utilization
 Lambda invocation counts
 RDS database connections

2) CloudWatch Logs
- Stores and analyzes log files
- Key Capabilities:
 Log Groups (containers for logs)
 Log Streams (individual log sources)
 Log Insights (SQL-like querying)
- Example Use: Debugging Lambda function errors

3) CloudWatch Alarms
- Automated notifications based on metrics
- Alert Types:
 Threshold-based (CPU > 90%)
 Anomaly detection (AI-powered)
- Actions:
 SNS notifications
 Auto Scaling triggers
 EC2 stop/start

4) CloudWatch Events (EventBridge)
- CloudWatch events help you to create a set of rules that match with any event(i.e. stopping of EC2 instance).
- CloudWatch Events observes the operational events continuously and whenever there is any change in the state
  of the event, it performs the action by sending notifications, activating lambda, etc.
- An event indicates a change in the AWS environment. Whenever there is a change in the state of AWS 
  resources, events are generated.

5) CloudWatch Agent 
- It is required to be installed.
- It is used to collect metrics and logs from EC2 instances and on-premises servers.
- Steps to install the agent for ubuntu:
  1. wget https://amazoncloudwatch-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ubuntu/amd64/latest/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.deb
  2. sudo dpkg -i -E ./amazon-cloudwatch-agent.deb
  OR
  1. wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent/linux/amd64/latest/AmazonCloudWatchAgent.zip
  2. unzip AmazonCloudWatchAgent.zip
  3. sudo ./install.sh
  Then Enable and Start the agent using 'sudo systemctl enable --now amazon-cloudwatch-agent'  
  

6) CloudWatch dashboard
- A user-friendly CloudWatch console is available which is used for monitoring resources in a single view.
- There is no limit on the number of CloudWatch dashboards you can create.
- These dashboards are global and not region-specific.
