# Serverless Service
- A serverless service allows you to run code without managing the underlying infrastructure (servers).

# Advantages of AWS Lambda Function
- No Server Management: You donâ€™t need to provision or manage servers.
- Auto-Scaling: Lambda automatically scales based on the number of events.
- Pay-as-You-Go: You only pay for the compute time your code consumes.
- Quick Deployment: Easy to deploy small, event-driven functions.
- Highly Available: Built-in fault tolerance across multiple availability zones.
- Integrated with AWS Services: Easily trigger via S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, etc.


# What is the maximum execution timeout for a Lambda function?
- The maximum timeout for an AWS Lambda function is 15 minutes (900 seconds) per invocation.
- You can set the timeout in the configuration settings when you create or update the function.
- If the function exceeds the timeout, it is automatically terminated by AWS, and an error is returned.
- Example:
    If your function is doing a long-running task, like file processing or waiting on a slow API, and it runs for more than 15 minutes, Lambda will stop it, and the invocation will fail.

# How is pricing calculated for AWS Lambda?
- AWS Lambda pricing is calculated based on the following:
1. Number of Requests:
- First 1 million requests/month are free
- After that: $0.20 per 1 million requests

2. Duration (Execution Time):
- Billed in milliseconds
- Based on the time your code runs, from start to finish, rounded up to the nearest 1 ms
- Includes the time it takes to initialize the function (cold start)

3. Memory Allocated:
- You choose memory from 128 MB to 10,240 MB (10 GB)
- More memory = more CPU power
- Pricing increases with more memory and longer execution time
ðŸ’¡ Formula:
  Duration (ms) Ã— Memory (MB) Ã— Price per GB-second

ðŸ’µ Example Calculation:
Let's say:
Your function runs for 1 second
You allocated 512 MB memory
You invoked it 2 million times in a month
Request cost:
First 1M = free
Next 1M = 1 Ã— $0.20 = $0.20 

Duration cost:
(1 sec Ã— 2M) = 2M seconds = 2,000,000 sec Ã— 512 MB
Convert to GB-seconds = (512/1024) Ã— 2,000,000 = 1,000,000 GB-seconds
Pricing is approx $0.0000166667 per GB-sec
Cost = 1,000,000 Ã— $0.0000166667 = $16.67
Total cost = $0.20 (requests) + $16.67 (duration) = $16.87
