# Virtual Private Network (VPC)
- VPC is a fundamental networking service that allows you to create an isolated section of the AWS Cloud
  where you can launch resources in a logically defined virtual network.
- We define its IP address range (CIDR block) (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).
- It spans an AWS Region but can be divided into multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability.

# Internet GateWay (IGW)
- A scalable, highly available AWS-managed service attached to a VPC.
- Allows two-way internet communication:
  Outbound: EC2 instances in a public subnet can reach the internet.
  Inbound: Internet users can access a public EC2 instance (e.g., a website).
- Only works with public subnets (private subnets use NAT Gateway instead).

# Subnets
- A subnet is a smaller division of a VPC’s IP range (CIDR block).
- Each subnet must belong to one Availability Zone (AZ) for fault tolerance.
- Types of Subnets:
 1) Public Subnet: Has a route to the internet (via an Internet Gateway).
    Example: Web servers, Load Balancers.
 2) Private Subnet: No direct internet access; used for backend services (e.g., databases).
    Example: Databases, Internal APIs.

# Route Table
- A set of rules (routes) that determine where network traffic is directed.
- Each subnet must be associated with a route table (default or custom).
- Key Routes - Internet-bound traffic (0.0.0.0/0 → goes to IGW or NAT Gateway).

# Nat Gateway (NGW)
- Allows private subnets to access the internet (for updates, patches, etc.) without exposing them to inbound traffic.
- Deployed in a public subnet (since it needs an IGW to reach the internet).
- Uses Elastic IPs for a static public IP.
- Example: A database in a private subnet uses a NAT Gateway to download security patches.
