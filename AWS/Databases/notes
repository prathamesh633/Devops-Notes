# Database
- a database is a fully managed or self-managed data storage service that allows you to store, retrieve,
  and manage structured or unstructured data in the cloud.
-  AWS offers a variety of database services optimized for different use cases, including relational,
   NoSQL, in-memory, graph, and time-series databases.

1) Relational Databases (MySQL)
- A relational database organizes data into tables with rows and columns, where relationships between tables
  are defined using foreign keys.
- It follows ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying.
- Relational database is a STRUCTURED database.
- AWS services - RDS (Relational Database Service), Aurora.
- Real world example -- A pizza shop database, When a customer calls to order, their details are stored in the customers table,
   their order is saved in the orders table and the ingridents of the pizza are stored in the ingredients table.

2. NoSQL Databases (Not Only SQL)
- NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases store data in flexible, schema-less formats (JSON, key-value, documents, graphs).
- NoSQL is a UNSTRUCTURED database.
- They prioritize scalability and performance over strict consistency.
- AWS services - DynamoDB, DocumentDB.
- Real world example - Imagine a Twitter-like app where: Users post tweets (with hashtags, likes, comments),
  Each user has a profile (with changing data like bio, followers), Data grows rapidly (millions of posts per day).
  When a user posts a tweet, it’s added to their document (no fixed schema).
 The app can quickly fetch: A user’s profile + all their tweets in one query. Trending hashtags by scanning tweets.
 Scales easily—no need to split data across tables.


# RDS Backup
- Manuel method
  1. Go to the RDS dashboard
  2. Select the instance
  3. Click on the "Actions" dropdown menu
  4. Select "Create snapshot"
- Automated method
  We can do this while creating the RDS in 'Advanced Configuration' section.
  OR
  We can do it in the AWS backup and create 'Ptotected resources' of RDS and to automate it we can use 'Backup plans'.
