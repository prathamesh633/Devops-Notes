# PostgreSQL
- PostgreSQL (often called Postgres) is a powerful, open-source relational database system.
- “Relational” means it organizes data in tables (rows and columns) and allows relationships between tables.
- It’s ACID-compliant, meaning it ensures data is reliable, consistent, and safe even during failures.
- Open-source and free, with a strong community and lots of extensions.
- default port 5432.

# Why people use PostgreSQL
- Advanced queries: You can do complex searches, aggregate data, and even use JSON.
- Extensibility: Add custom functions, types, or extensions (like PostGIS for maps).
- Reliability: Strong transactions, rollback support, foreign keys.
- Scalable & concurrent: Can handle lots of users at the same time.
- Free & open source: No licensing cost, lots of community support.

# Examples of PostgreSQL
- Financial applications → Apps like banking, accounting, or stock trading need every number to be exact and reliable.
  PostgreSQL makes sure nothing is lost or wrong even if the system crashes.

- Web apps with complex data → If your app needs to connect lots of things together, like users, posts, comments,
  and likes (like Facebook), PostgreSQL can handle these relationships and complex searches easily.

- Apps with geospatial data → Apps like Uber, Google Maps, or delivery apps need to know locations, distances,
  and routes. PostgreSQL with PostGIS can store and calculate all this location data efficiently.

- Analytics dashboards or JSON data → Some apps need reports, charts, or semi-structured data (like user preferences in JSON).
  PostgreSQL can handle both regular tables and JSON data at the same time, making analytics easier.
