# Route53
- Amazon Route53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) web service.
- It helps route end users to internet applications by translating domain names (like example.com) into IP addresses.
- Health Checks → Monitors endpoints (HTTP, TCP, HTTPS) & reroutes if unhealthy.
- Private DNS → Resolves internal AWS resources (e.g., EC2, RDS) within a VPC.
- Traffic Routing Policies (Decides how requests are directed) ------------------------>
  1. Simple Routing → Basic round-robin (no health checks).
  
  2. Weighted Routing → Distributes traffic based on assigned weights (e.g., 70% to US, 30% to EU).
  
  3. Latency-Based Routing → Sends users to the fastest region.
  
  4. Failover Routing → Active-Passive setup (if primary fails, backup takes over).
  
  5. Geolocation Routing → Routes based on user’s country.


Q. Difference between A Record and CNAME?
A. A record maps a domain to an IP. 
   CNAME maps a domain to another domain (e.g., www → root domain).
