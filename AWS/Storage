# Elastic Block Storage (EBS) ----->



- We use 'fdisk /dev/disk_name' to create a new partition on the EBS volume.
- we can see the created partation using 'lsblk' command.
- After creating the partition, we use 'mkfs.ext4 /dev/disk_name1' to asign a file system to the partition.
- we can see if the file system is created successfully using 'lsblk -fs' command.
- Then we mount the partition to the /mnt directory using 'mount /dev/disk_name1 /mnt' command.
- To unmount the partition, we use 'umount /dev/disk_name /mnt' command. This method will detach the partition without harming the data.

Above method will mount the partition temperorly . If you want to mount the partition permanently,
- we need to edit the /etc/fstab file to add the partition information.
- we use 'sudo  vim /etc/fstab' command to edit the file.
- we add the following line to the end of the file:
  /dev/disk_name1  /mnt/(directory where the partition will be mounted)  ext4(file_system)  defaults  0  0
               OR
  UUID=___________ /mnt/(directory where the partition will be mounted)  ext4(file_system)  defaults  0  0 
  (lsblk -fs will give the UUID) 

        UUID=fde79620-9248-49c7-ba97-51dfd08ceef2 /mnt/xvdbc2 ext4 defaults 0 0
         UUID=fe7b763d-58b4-4450-872f-e70c91f94e82 /mnt/xvdbc1 ext4 defaults 0 0 
- After editing the file, we use 'sudo mount -a' command to mount all the mentioned partition permanently.
- To unmount all the mentioned partition, we use 'sudo umount -a' command.


# Network File System (NFS) ----->


- Create EFS and ensure that the security group has the necessary inbound rules to allow NFS traffic(port 2049).\
- Also add the port 2049 in the instance security group.
- Then go to the EFS we created and inside it click attach and add the EFS to the instance using the provided command.
  We can mount vai DNS OR IP address.
- The above command will temperoryaly mount the EFS to the mentioned directory.
- To mount the EFS permanently, we need to edit the /etc/fstab file.
- Go in the /etc/fstab file and add the following line to the end of the file:
  if mounted vai DNS -- fs-098c5dd**********.efs.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com: /mnt/demo_dir nfs defaults 0 0
  if mounted vai IP address -- 192.168.1.1 /mnt/demo_dir nfs defaults 0 0
