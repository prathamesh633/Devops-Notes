# Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- Object storage service for storing and retrieving any amount of data at anytime from anywhere on the web.
- An Amazon S3 bucket is basically a container for storing objects (files + metadata) in AWS.
- Think of it as a folder at the top level where you keep all your files in S3.
- But unlike a local folder, a bucket has global unique names and lives in a specific AWS region.

# Storage Classes:
1.	S3 Standard
2.	S3 Intelligent-Tiering
3.	S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)
4.	S3 One Zone-IA (Infrequent Access)
5.	S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
6.	S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
7.	S3 Glacier Deep Archive
8.	S3 Express One Zone

# S3 bucket lifecycle rule
- An S3 bucket lifecycle rule is a set of rules you apply to an Amazon S3 bucket (or objects in it) to automatically manage the 
  storage lifecycle of your data.
  (When we say “storage lifecycle” in the context of S3, we mean the different stages an object goes through from the time it is created until it is eventually deleted.)

# What Lifecycle Rule Does
- Transition actions → Move objects to a cheaper storage class (e.g., S3 Standard → S3 Glacier).
- Expiration actions → Delete objects or their previous versions after a set time.

# Fields You Need to Fill When Creating a Lifecycle Rule

- Status
  Options: Enabled / Disabled
  Why we fill it: You might want to create the rule but not activate it immediately.

- Lifecycle rule actions
  You must choose what happens to your objects:
  a. Move objects to a cheaper storage class after X days.
  b. Permanently delete objects after X days.
  c. Delete the newest (current) version after X days.
  d. Delete the previous/older versions after X days.
  e. Deletes unfinished multipart uploads after X days.

- Review transition and expiration actions
  After setting all actions, AWS shows you a summary before saving.
