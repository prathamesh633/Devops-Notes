# Types of Instances
1. General Purpose Instances
   Best for: Balanced compute, memory, and networking.
   Use Cases: Web servers, small databases, development environments.
   Examples:
    t4g, t3 (Burstable Performance) – Low-cost, burstable CPU (good for variable workloads).
    m6i, m7g (Standard General Purpose) – Balanced resources for most applications.

2. Compute Optimized Instances
   Best for: High-performance computing (HPC), batch processing, gaming servers.
   Use Cases: CPU-intensive tasks like machine learning, video encoding.
   Examples:
    c7g (Graviton3), c6i (Intel) – High CPU power with cost efficiency.

3. Memory Optimized Instances
   Best for: Memory-intensive workloads (databases, caching).
   Use Cases: In-memory databases (Redis, SAP HANA), real-time analytics.
   Examples:
    r7g (Graviton3), r6i (Intel) – High RAM-to-CPU ratio.
    x2gd (Graviton2) – Extra-large memory for big data.

4. Storage Optimized Instances
   Best for: High-speed, low-latency storage.
   Use Cases: NoSQL databases (Cassandra), data warehousing, log processing.
   Examples:
    i4i (Intel) – Fast NVMe SSD storage.
    d3en (Dense HDD Storage) – High-capacity HDDs for large datasets.

5. Accelerated Computing (GPU/FPGA Instances)
   Best for: Parallel processing, AI/ML, graphics rendering.
   Use Cases: Deep learning (TensorFlow), 3D rendering, scientific simulations.
   Examples:
    p5 (NVIDIA H100) – High-performance GPU for AI.
    g5 (NVIDIA A10G) – Cost-effective GPU for ML inference.
    f1 (FPGA) – Custom hardware acceleration.

6. HPC Optimized Instances
   Best for: High-performance computing clusters.
   Use Cases: Weather modeling, financial simulations.
   Examples:
    hpc7g (Graviton3) – High throughput, low latency.

7. Bare Metal Instances
   Best for: Non-virtualized workloads (licensing-sensitive apps).
   Use Cases: Legacy apps requiring direct hardware access.
   Examples:
    m6i.metal, r6i.metal – Full server control.
