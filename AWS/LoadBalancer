# Load Balancer
- A Load Balancer (LB) is service that distributes incoming requests across multiple servers
  (e.g., EC2 instances) to ensure no single server gets overwhelmed.
- Advantages ----->
  Fault Tolerance – If one server fails, traffic shifts to healthy ones.
  Scalability – Handles increased traffic by adding more backend servers.
  Performance – Reduces latency by routing requests to the nearest/closest server.
  Security – Can integrate with WAF (Web Application Firewall) and SSL termination.

# Types of Load Balancers ------------------>
1) Application Load Balancer (ALB) 
- Works On Application Layer (Layer 7) (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Best for: Web applications (microservices, containers, serverless).
- Routes traffic based on URL path (/api, /images) or hostname (blog.example.com).
- Use Case:
  A blog site routing /posts to one server group and /images to another.

2) Network Load Balancer (NLB) 
- Works On Transport Layer (Layer 4) (TCP/UDP)
- Best for: High-performance, low-latency apps (gaming, real-time streaming).
- Key Features:
  Handles millions of requests per second with ultra-low latency.
  Supports static IP & Elastic IP.
  Used for non-HTTP traffic (e.g., databases, gaming servers).
- Use Case:
  A multiplayer game server needing fast, reliable connections.

3) Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) 
- Works On Network Layer (Layer 3) (IP)
- Best for: Deploying third-party virtual appliances (firewalls, intrusion detection).
- Use Case:
  A company inspecting all traffic via a firewall VM before sending it to servers.

4) Classic Load Balancer (CLB) 
- the Classic Load Balancer (CLB) operates primarily at Layer 4 (Transport Layer) of the OSI model.
  It uses protocols like TCP and SSL to route traffic. 
  However, it also has some functionality at Layer 7 (Application Layer), as it can handle HTTP and HTTPS traffic,
  allowing for basic routing decisions based on application-level data.
- It is Old Generation and is Not recommended for new use cases.

# Target Group
- A Target Group is the list of servers (targets) that will receive traffic from the Load Balancer.
- A logical grouping of EC2 instances, IP addresses, Lambda functions, or containers that receive traffic from a Load Balancer.
- Health checks are performed at the Target Group level to determine which targets are available.
  Health Check --->
  -  A periodic test that verifies whether backend targets (like EC2 instances) can properly receive and respond to requests.
  How Health Checks Work (Step-by-Step)
  - LB: "Are you alive?" (Sends request)
  - Target: "200 OK" (Healthy) or timeout/crash (Unhealthy)
  Automatic Response
  If healthy → stays in rotation
  If unhealthy → stops receiving traffic until it recovers
