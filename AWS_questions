#Q. what is tenancy in AWS?
A. In AWS, tenancy refers to the arrangement and isolation of resources, particularly virtual machines
 (EC2 instances), within the AWS infrastructure. It determines whether the infrastructure hosting your 
 instances is shared with other AWS customers or dedicated exclusively to your use. This impacts factors
 like performance isolation, compliance, and cost.
 Types:-
 1. Shared Tenancy
  - This is the default and most cost-effective option.
  - Instances are hosted on physical servers that may also be shared with other AWS customers.
 2. Dedicated Tenancy
  -  Instances run on hardware dedicated to a single AWS customer.
 3. Host Tenancy
  - A subset of dedicated tenancy where the customer explicitly controls the allocation of instances to specific Dedicated Hosts.
  - 
 4. Spot and Reserved Instances
  - These are not tenancy types but are related to instance allocation and pricing models.
  - Spot and reserved instances can be launched with default or dedicated tenancy, depending on your needs.
  - Ideal for workloads that are flexible and can handle interruptions.
