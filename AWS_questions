# Q. What is Cloud?
A. The term "Cloud" in computing refers to a model of delivering computing services over the internet, where resources such 
 as servers, storage, databases, software, and applications are provided as a service to users on-demand. Instead of having to 
 manage and maintain their own hardware and software, users can access these resources on a pay-as-you-go basis, allowing for
 greater flexibility, scalability, and cost savings.

 Cloud computing has a wide range of applications, including:
 Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides virtualized computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networking.

 Platform as a Service (PaaS): Provides a complete development and deployment environment for applications, including tools, libraries, 
 and infrastructure.

 Software as a Service (SaaS): Provides software applications over the internet, eliminating the need for local installation 
 and maintenance.

# Q. What is virtulization?
A. It is like a layer abover our OS that helps us to use other OS oer other computing resources on our system.
- Like we can use Linux OS on our windows system using virtulization.
- These OS that we run above the virtulization layer that work independently but share same hardware are called virtual machines (MV's).
- In virtualization the hypervisor is the one that enables virtulization process.

# Q. What is Hypervisor? mention its types.
A. This is the software layer that works above the host OS and enables virtualization by managing VMs and allocating hardware resources.
- The virtual machines that works on hypervisor shares resources from the host machine.
- There are two types of hypervisors:
  1. Type 1 (Bare-Metal): Runs directly on hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V).
  2. Type 2 (Hosted): Runs on top of an OS (e.g., Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Workstation).

# Q. What is AMI in AWS?
A. An AMI is a template that contains the software configuration (operating system, application server, and applications)
 required to launch an instance (a virtual server) in the cloud.
 It is like a pre-configured image of a virtual machine that you can use to quickly launch EC2 instances.

# Q. what is userdata in AWS?
A. In AWS, user data is a feature that allows you to pass custom scripts or configuration instructions to an EC2 
 instance during its launch. These scripts are executed automatically when the instance starts for the first time. 

# Q. what is tenancy in AWS?
A. In AWS, tenancy refers to the arrangement and isolation of resources, particularly virtual machines
 (EC2 instances), within the AWS infrastructure. It determines whether the infrastructure hosting your 
 instances is shared with other AWS customers or dedicated exclusively to your use. This impacts factors
 like performance isolation, compliance, and cost.
 Types:-
 1. Shared Tenancy
  - This is the default and most cost-effective option.
  - Instances are hosted on physical servers that may also be shared with other AWS customers.
 2. Dedicated Tenancy
  -  Instances run on hardware dedicated to a single AWS customer.
 3. Host Tenancy
  - A subset of dedicated tenancy where the customer explicitly controls the allocation of instances to specific Dedicated Hosts.
  - 
 4. Spot and Reserved Instances
  - These are not tenancy types but are related to instance allocation and pricing models.
  - Spot and reserved instances can be launched with default or dedicated tenancy, depending on your needs.
  - Ideal for workloads that are flexible and can handle interruptions.

# Q. What is EBS in AWS?
A. EBS stands for Elastic Block Store. It is a block storage service provided by AWS that allows you to create
 persistent block storage volumes and attach them to EC2 instances. EBS volumes are independent of the EC2 instances
 they are attached to and can be detached and reattached to other instances.
 They are used for storing data that requires frequent and fast access, such as databases, file systems, and application data.
 Our instance and EBS should be in the same availability zone to establish a conneection. 

# Q. What is NFS in AWS?
A. In AWS, NFS (Network File System) refers to a file system that allows multiple EC2 instances or other AWS services to share
 files over a network.
 Port number of NFS: 2049
 We use this service with EFS (Elastic File System) which is a scalable, fully managed NFS file system service provided by AWS.
 A big drawback of NFS is if our main server is down then no one can access the data and even we can lose our data.

# Q. Difference between EBS and EFS
A.       EBS(Elastic Block Storage)                  |           NFS(Network File Storage)
 1. Attached to a single EC2 instance                |   Shared across multiple instances 
   (not natively shared across multiple instances).  |  (via Amazon EFS or self-managed NFS servers).  
                                                     |
 2. Low latency (directly attached to EC2)           |    Higher latency (network-based access). 
                                                     |
 3. Fixed size(manually scaled, requires resizing).  |   Elastic scaling (automatically grows with data).
                                                     |
 4. Available in single Availability-Zone.           |   Available in Multiple Availability-Zones by default.  
                                                     |  
 5. Use Case - Databases, Boot Volumes               |   Use Case - Shared Apps, Web Servers

# Q. What is a VPC in and explain all components of a VPC? 
A. A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is like your own private space/network in the cloud where you can set up and manage your resources 
 (like servers, databases, etc.). It’s isolated from others, so you have full control over how things are connected and secured.
 Components of a VPC:
 1. Subnets
  Think of subnets as smaller sections within your VPC, like rooms in a house. Each subnet has its own range of IP addresses.
  Some subnets can be public (like a living room where guests can visit) and others can be private (like a bedroom where 
  only you have access). Subnets help organize your resources and control who can talk to what.

 2. Internet Gateway (IGW)
  An internet gateway is like the front door of your VPC that connects it to the internet. If you want your resources 
  (like a website) to be accessible online, you attach an internet gateway to your VPC. It lets traffic flow in and out 
  of your VPC securely. 

 3. Route Tables
  Route tables are like road signs that tell traffic where to go. They contain rules (routes) that decide how data moves between 
  subnets, the internet, or other networks. For example, if you want traffic from a subnet to go to the internet, you add a 
  route pointing to the internet gateway. 
 
 4. NAT Gateway
  A NAT Gateway is like a one-way door for your private resources (like EC2 instances) in a VPC. It lets them go out to the internet 
  (for example, to download updates or access external services), but it blocks anything from the internet from coming in.
  This keeps your private resources safe and secure while still allowing them to do what they need to do online.

# Q. Difference between NACLs(Network Access Control Lists) and security groups?
A.
 NACLs --> NACLs are like security guards at the entrance of a subnet. They check all the traffic going in and out of the subnet
 and decide whether to allow or block it based on rules you set. 

 Security Groups --> Security groups are like personal bodyguards for your resources (like servers). They control who can talk
 to the resource and what kind of traffic is allowed.

                NACL                                 |           Security Group
 1. Operates at the subnet level                     |   Operates at the instance level 
   (applies to all resources in a subnet).           |   (applies to individual resources like EC2 instances).  
                                                     |
 2. Stateless: You must explicitly allow inbound     |   Stateful: If you allow inbound traffic, outbound 
    and outbound traffic.                            |   traffic is automatically allowed, and vice versa.
                                                     |
 3. Rules are evaluated in order (top to bottom)     |   Rules are evaluated as a whole (no order); all rules 
    based on rule numbers.                           |   are considered equally.
                                                     |
 4. It both 'allows'and 'deny' permission.           |   It only 'allows' permission.

# Q. What are Placement groups in AWS?
A. Placement Groups in AWS are logical groupings of EC2 instances within a single Availability Zone.
 They help control the placement of instances to optimize for low latency, high network throughput, or redundancy.
 There are three types:
  1. Cluster – Places instances close together for low latency.

  2. Spread – Distributes instances across hardware to reduce the risk of failure.

  3. Partition – Divides instances into partitions for large-scale, fault-tolerant applications.

# Q. What is a NIC (Network Interface Card) in AWS?
A. A Network Interface Card (NIC) in AWS is a virtual network card that you can attach to an EC2 instance.
 It gives the instance a private IP address, and optionally, a public IP address or Elastic IP address. 
 They are essential for enabling network communication for your instances in a VPC.
 You can attach multiple NICs to an instance to enable it to connect to different subnets or networks.
 Our instance and NIC should be in the same subnet to establish a conneection.

# Q. What is a LoadBalancer and its types?
A. A Load Balancer in AWS is like a traffic cop for your applications. It distributes incoming traffic across multiple 
 servers (like EC2 instances) to ensure no single server gets overwhelmed. This improves the availability, scalability,
 and fault tolerance of your application.
 Components of a Load Balancer:
 1. Listeners:
 A listener checks for incoming traffic on a specific port (e.g., HTTP on port 80 or HTTPS on port 443) and forwards it
  to the target groups.

 2. Target Groups:
 A target group is a set of servers (like EC2 instances) that receive traffic from the load balancer. The load balancer 
 routes traffic to healthy targets.

 3. Health Checks:
 The load balancer regularly checks the health of the servers. If a server fails the health check, the load balancer stops 
 sending traffic to it.
 

# Q. How does the loadbalancer check if the service is healthy?

# Q. When do we use lamda function and when do we use EC2 instance?
