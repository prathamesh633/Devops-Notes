#Q. What is Cloud?

#Q. What is AMI in AWS?
A. An AMI is a template that contains the software configuration (operating system, application server, and applications)
 required to launch an instance (a virtual server) in the cloud.
 It is like a pre-configured image of a virtual machine that you can use to quickly launch EC2 instances.

#Q. what is userdata in AWS?
A. In AWS, user data is a feature that allows you to pass custom scripts or configuration instructions to an EC2 
 instance during its launch. These scripts are executed automatically when the instance starts for the first time. 



#Q. what is tenancy in AWS?
A. In AWS, tenancy refers to the arrangement and isolation of resources, particularly virtual machines
 (EC2 instances), within the AWS infrastructure. It determines whether the infrastructure hosting your 
 instances is shared with other AWS customers or dedicated exclusively to your use. This impacts factors
 like performance isolation, compliance, and cost.
 Types:-
 1. Shared Tenancy
  - This is the default and most cost-effective option.
  - Instances are hosted on physical servers that may also be shared with other AWS customers.
 2. Dedicated Tenancy
  -  Instances run on hardware dedicated to a single AWS customer.
 3. Host Tenancy
  - A subset of dedicated tenancy where the customer explicitly controls the allocation of instances to specific Dedicated Hosts.
  - 
 4. Spot and Reserved Instances
  - These are not tenancy types but are related to instance allocation and pricing models.
  - Spot and reserved instances can be launched with default or dedicated tenancy, depending on your needs.
  - Ideal for workloads that are flexible and can handle interruptions.

#Q. What is EBS in AWS?
A. EBS stands for Elastic Block Store. It is a block storage service provided by AWS that allows you to create
 persistent block storage volumes and attach them to EC2 instances. EBS volumes are independent of the EC2 instances
 they are attached to and can be detached and reattached to other instances.
 They are used for storing data that requires frequent and fast access, such as databases, file systems, and application data.

#Q. What is NFS in AWS?
A. In AWS, NFS (Network File System) refers to a file system that allows multiple EC2 instances or other AWS services to share
 files over a network.
 Port number of NFS: 2049
 We use this service with EFS (Elastic File System) which is a scalable, fully managed NFS file system service provided by AWS.
 A big drawback of NFS is if our main server is down then no one can access the data and even we can lose our data.
