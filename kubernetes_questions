#Q. Difference between Stateful set, Daemon set and Deployment? (min 5 points)
#Ans 
 Stateful set: 
 - Manages stateful applications with stable, unique network identities and persistent storage.( Stateful applications are
  those that maintain data or state across restarts, meaning the application's data and network identity persist over time.)
 - Pods have unique, stable identities (e.g., pod-0, pod-1) that persist across rescheduling.
 - Uses persistent volume claims (PVCs) to provide stable storage linked to pod identity. Every stateful set has a 
  PV(persistant volume) on it.
 - Pods are scheduled in a specific order; replicas are not started until previous ones are running. 
 - Use Cases:- Databases (e.g., MySQL, Cassandra), applications requiring stable identity or storage.

 Daemon set:
 - A DaemonSet ensures that a single instance of a pod is running on each node in a cluster.This is particularly useful
  for running pods as system daemons or background processes that need to run on every node in the cluster.
 - Each pod is tied to a specific node, and no two pods run on the same node.
 - Storage is node-specific and generally ephemeral(temporary storage that exists only during the lifecycle of a pod).
 - Ensures a pod is scheduled on every eligible node.
 - use cases:- Logging agents, monitoring daemons, and node-level services.

 Deployment:
 - Manages stateless applications with replicas of pod.
 - All pods are identical and interchangeable.
 - Can use ephemeral storage and PVCs as per the need.
 - Pods are scheduled independently and can run simultaneously.
 - use cases:- Stateless web applications, APIs, and batch processing.
