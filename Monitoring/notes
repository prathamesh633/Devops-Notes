# OBSERVABILITY.
Under it  comes different fileds.
1. Monitoring :
   What is happening in application.
   to see the applications CPU, memory , disk usage etc.
   To see different metrics.
2. Logging :
   To check the logs of the application.
   Like of we are facing errors we can store the logs of those errors.
3. Tracing :
   After encountering errors in logs, how we get to the errors is done in tracing.
   How to resolve the errors is done in tracing.
4. Alerting :
   When we encounter spike in the CPU or memory usage which is more than we thought we can set alerts for that.
5. Visualization :
   We create dashboards to see all the fileds we want in one place.



# Installation Prometheus and Grafana using Helm
To Integrate Prometheus and Grafana with Kubernetes, we can use Helm. Here is how to do it(do it after creating the application):

helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
kubectl create namespace monitoring
helm install prometheus-stack prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --namespace monitoring

kubectl get pods -n monitoring

kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-stack-grafana 3000:80 -n monitoring
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-stack-kube-p-prometheus 9090:9090 -n monitoring

then login in to grafana and just import dashboards according to your application from the internet(https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/).
