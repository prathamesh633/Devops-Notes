# Prometheus
- For The monotring, logging and tracing in our application we use Prometheus.
- Prometheus is a Time Series Database that collects metrics from applications and services at configured intervals.
   eg: it tells us what will be the data afte 5min, 10min, 15min,etc.
- To create prometheus we require to create few manifest files in kubernetes. 
- By Storing all the manifest files in the same folder it gets easier for use to manages them.
- Port number of prometheus is 9090.

- There is a tool in Prometheus 'Node Exporter'. Its function is to export info. like CPU, memory, disk 
  usage, etc. of the node to the Prometheus server.


  Port forwarding command -
   kubectl port-forward svc/kind-prometheus-kube-prome-prometheus -n monitoring 9090:9090 --address=0.0.0.0 &
