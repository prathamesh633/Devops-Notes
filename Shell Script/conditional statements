# Conditional Statements
- We can also use 'if' and 'elif' statements in shell script to give conditions.
- 'if' condition syntax
 if [[ condition ]];
 then
  ...
  ...
 elif [[ condition ]];
 then
  ...
  ... 
 else
  ...
  ...
 fi

- eg.
 #!/bin/bash
 echo -p "what is your name: " correctname
 echo -p "are you a creator: " creator
 if [[ $correctname = "master" ]];
 then
  echo "You are the correct master"
 elif [[ $creator = "yes" ]];
 then
  echo "You are also the master" 
 else
  echo "You are a slave"
 fi
