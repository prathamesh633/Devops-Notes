To undertand shell scripting we must know linux architecture.

# linux architecture
 to keep the linux architecture in mind we must ASK as:

 A --> applications

 S --> shell

 K --> kernal
 
 Hardware --> the hardware components

 The kernal is written in C language. It is through kernal we can talk to the hardware,
 Through shell we can talk to the kernal. It makes easier for us to talk to the hardware.

# Little History
 Linux was invinted by Linus Torvalds in 1991.  

 Linus Torvals and Steve Bourne are the creaters of the sh shell.
  /bin/sh --> this is the place where the sh shell is located in linux.

  After improving sh shell more and more it became bash shell.
  bash --> Bourne Again Shell
  /bin/bash --> this is the place where the bash shell is located in linux.

# Requirments for writing shell script:
 Linux system
 bash shell or which ever shell we are using
 text editor

- Shell script file ends with '.sh'. (eg. myscript.sh)
- when we write a shell script we mention which shell we are writing our script in.
  It is called 'shebang'.
  eg. #!/bin/bash --> we are specifying bashshell.
      hear "#" means that the this line should not be used in the script.
- The shell script file that we wrote should have 'executable' permission.(we can do that using chmod command)
- The file after giving the executable permission will appear green in colour.
- We can run the file using './(file_name)' command and also use 'bash file_name' command to run the file.
- '#' can be used to comment words or sentences in the script. Those words or sentences will not be executed.
- We can use << any_word      any_word to write multi line comments.
  eg. << comment 
       Anything written
       hear will not
       be executed
       comment
