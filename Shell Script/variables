#  Variables
- We can assign values to variables using '=' operator inside a script.
 (variable_name) = 'string/number/etc.'
  eg. name="John" --> name is assigned a string called 'Jhon'
- If we want to use the defined variable we use '$' operator before the variable name.
  eg. echo "My name is $name"
    output --> My name is John
- We can also use commands as variable using '$(command)'.
  eg. echo "My name is $name and the day and date is $(date)"
- We can also take input variables from user using 'read' command.
  read variable_name
  eg. echo "Enter username:"
     read username
     echo "Hello $username"
     This will stop after first line and take the input first and then prit the second line.
- We can also give prompt along while talking the input using 'read -p' command.
 eg. read -p "Enter username: " username
     echo "Hello $username"

The things we learned above can help us to create a new user while talking input from user.
    #!/bin/bash
    read -p "Enter the new user name: " username
    sudo adduser -m $username
    echo "added new user $username"
we can check if the new user is created or not by looking at the bottom of /etc/passwd file.
