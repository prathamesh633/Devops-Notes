# Arguments
- We can pass arguments to the script while running the script.
 eg. ./myscript.sh arg1 arg2 arg3
- This helps us in things like when we want to run the same script with different inputs.
- Like while creating multiple users we can pass the username as argument.
- we mention the arguments in the script using $1, $2, $3 etc. where $1 is the first argument and so on.
