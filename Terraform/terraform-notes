# Terraform
- We use Terraform to manage our IAC(Infrastructure As Code).
- It is used to create resources on cloud.
- We cannot make it on premises as it is code.
- terraform file name --> file_name.tf
  main.tf --> 
  provider.tf. --> cloud provider configuration file to define aur service provider.
  var.tf or variable.tf --> if our terraform file needs some variables we define them here.
