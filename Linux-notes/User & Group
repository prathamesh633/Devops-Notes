# USERS and GROUPS

- Users and Groups are used to control access to files and resources.
- Every File in a system is owned by a user and associated with a group.
- Every user in the system is assigned a unique user ID (UID).
- USers name and UID are stored in the /etc/passwd file.
- Groups are assigned a unique group ID (GID).
- Groups name and GID are stored in the /etc/group file.

Commands: 
- adduser --> command is used to create a new user.  
              we can use 'useradd' but it is a low level command and does not create
              a home directory for the user. So, it is not recommended to use.

- userdel -->command used to delete a user.

- groupadd --> command used to create new group.

- groupdel -->command used to delete a group.

- usermod --> command used to modify a user.
   usermod -aG group_name user_name --> added the user to a secondary group without removing existing group.
   usermod -g group_name user_name --> Changes the primary group of the user. Unlike -aG, -g overrides the user's primary group.
   usermod -L user_name --> To lock the user from login.
   usermod -U user_name --> To unlock the user from login.

- gpasswd --> used to add or remove users from a group.
   gpasswd -d user_name group_name --> to remove a user from a group.(only removes secondary groups)
