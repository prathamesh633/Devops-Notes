1) lsblk --> used to list all the connected volumes to the server.
   lsblk -fs --> used to list all the connected volumes to the server with their file system details.

2) free -h --> The free -h command in Linux is used to display the system's memory usage (RAM and swap) in a human-readable format.
               Swap in Linux is a reserve space on your disk that acts as "overflow RAM" when your physical memory (RAM) is full.
               When RAM runs out, inactive processes are moved to swap to free up RAM.
               Prevents crashes but is much slower than RAM (since disks are slower than memory). 
               Useful for systems with low RAM, but excessive swapping ("thrashing") can slow down your system.

3) df -h --> The df command in Linux is used to check disk space usage on mounted filesystems.
             Shows total, used, and available space on all disks/partitions.

4) top --> The top command in Linux is used to display real-time system information.
           It gives us list of all the process based on their CPU usage, memory usage, and other parameters.

5) ps aux --> It is similar to top command but instead of showing the processed dynamically,
              it just prints them on the command line.

6) ps -ef --> also used to display information about a running process.
              It does not show the processes CPu usage or memory usage.
              It shows the process id, user id, PID, PPID and the command used to start the process.
