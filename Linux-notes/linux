# Linux
- It is a open source operating system.
- It was made by Linus Torwald.
- 
Bootloader:
- It is a process in kernal that loads the operating system into the memory. It is the first program that runs when the computer is turned.
- eg. GRUB (grand unified bootloader)

states of processes:
- sleeping, running, killed, zombie, start etc.

Commands:
- Terminal is the interface between user and os.
- We run the commands on terminal.
zcat --> used to see contents of a zip file.
tail -f file_name --> used to see if any new lines are added to the bottom of file in real time. can be used to see logs.
less --> used to see the content of a file in small page by page formate.
more --> used to see the content of a file in big page by page formate.
wc --> gives the count of words of a file. eg: wc file.txt , output --> 1 4 16 (1 line, 4 words , 16 bytes(no. of letters))
df --> gives the disk free space. can use 'df -h' to see the free space in human readable format.
du --> gives the disk usage of a particular directory. eg: du . (it will give the disk usage of the current directory)
fuser --> 
nohup --> used to store the output of a command in a file. eg: nohup df -h (will store the disk info in a nohup.out file)
 if we run the command again to save the output of a different command it will keep the previous info as it is and add the new info below it.

- System level commands
 who --> tells about all the users and when they logged in.
 whoami --> tells about current user. 
 shutdown --> stops the ec2-instance. (sudo shutdown)

- Package manager commands 
 apt (advanced package tool) --> used to install and remove packages. Itwill search the mentioned package in our system.
 apt-get --> works as same as apt but if the mentioned package is not found in our system it will download it from the internet.
 dnf (dandified YUM) --> used to install package. it was introduced as a replacement to 'yum'.
 yum (yellodog updater, modified) --> used to install package.

- File system commands
 su (switch user) --> to switch between users.
 sudo gpasswd -a username groupname --> to add a user to a group.
 sudo gpasswd -M user1,user2,user3 groupname --> to add multiple users to a group.
compression commands
 zip --> used to compress a file & folders. eg: zip -r file.zip folder_name / zip file.zip file_name
 unzip --> used to decompress a file. eg: unzip file.zip

 scp (secure copy) --> used to copy files from one server to another.
  syntax: from local to server --> scp -i "key_path" file_name username@ip_address:path_of_where _to_copy
  eg: scp -i "Downloads/demo-key.pem" file.txt ec2-user@ec2-13-233-123-123.compute-1.amazonaws:/home/ec2-user/

 rsync --> It is used to sync the changes between the directories that we copied using 'scp'.
 syntax: rsync -avz -e ssh source destination

awk and sed --> These commands are used to get the desired data from a large pool of data.
 we can get desired columns, lines and words from the data using these commands.
 'awk' commands works mainly on getting the desired data from the file.
 'sed' command can also be used to change the words in the entire data file.

- Linux Volume commands
 1) lsblk (list block) --> used to list all the connected volumes to the server.
 2) commands to make divisions in the attached volumes --> fdisk /dev/block_name OR lvm (logical volume manager) 
 3) mkfs --> used to format the newly created volume i.e. we can attach the newly created divisions to the folders we want in the server.
 4) mount --> used to make the attached volumes usable for the instance. To unmount the volume we use 'umount' command.
 to permanently mount the volume we make a entry of the volume in '/etc/fstab' file as "UUID=uuid_of_volume /path_of_volume ext4 0 0 defaults".
 5) fdisk --> used to create new partitions in the volume.
