# Crontab
- Crontab in Linux is a scheduler that lets you run commands or scripts automatically at set times.

- The tasks that we schedule on crontab are called 'cronjobs'.

- Crontab is timezone specific, so to run a cronjob in india we have to change the time to Asia/Kolkata
  because the default timezone is UTC.
  (After changing restart the crond.service to apply the changes)

- To see if crontab is running we have to check the status of the 'crond.service'.
   "systemctl status crond.service"

- commands:
  crontab -e : edit the crontab file to schedule new job.
  crontab -l : we can see the crontab file in which we wrote the jobs using this command.
  crontab -e -u username : set a cronjob for a user.

- Inside the crontab file we schedule a job using the following format:
  syntax of a cronjob in crontab:
  * * * * *  command_to_be_executed
  eg: 0 9 * * *  python /home/user/backup.py --> this will run the python script at 9:00 am every day.
  their are 5 fields in the crontab file:
  *        *        *        *        *
