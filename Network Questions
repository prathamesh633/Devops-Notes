# Q. What is the Difference between TCP and UDP?
A. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- Connection-oriented: A connection is established before data is sent.
- Reliable: Data is guaranteed to be delivered in the correct order.
- Error-checked: TCP checks for errors and retransmits packets if errors are detected.
- Ordered delivery: TCP ensures that packets are delivered in the order they were sent.
- TCP is slower than UDP.
- examples: Email, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), web browsing, online banking, etc.

 UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- Connectionless: No connection is established before data is sent.
- Connectionless: No connection is established before data is sent.
- Error-tolerant: UDP does not check for errors or retransmit packets if errors are detected.
- It is faster than TCP
- examples: Online gaming, video streaming, voice over IP (VoIP), etc
