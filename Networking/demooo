Port Security

📌 Routing Concepts

Static vs Dynamic Routing

Routing Protocols – RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, BGP (basics only if junior level)

Default Route, Route Metrics

TCP vs UDP (ports, reliability, use cases)

HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, SNMP

📌 Wireless Networking

Wi-Fi Standards (802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax)

WPA2/WPA3 Security basics

SSID, Channels, Interference

📌 Network Security Basics

Firewalls & ACLs

VPNs (IPSec, SSL VPN)

Zero Trust basics

Common Attacks: DoS/DDoS, MITM, ARP spoofing

📌 Network Monitoring & Tools

Tools: ping, tracert/traceroute, ipconfig/ifconfig, netstat, nslookup/dig, tcpdump, Wireshark

SNMP, Syslog, NetFlow basics

📌 Cloud & Modern Networking (Intro level)

SD-WAN, SDN (concepts only)

Basics of load balancing & CDN (e.g., CloudFront, Akamai)

Networking in Cloud (AWS VPC basics: Subnets, Route tables, Security Groups, NACLs)

Networking Basics – Teaching Flow for Network Engineer
Session 1: Introduction to Networking

What is a computer network? Why do we need it?

Real-life examples: Internet, Office LAN, Home Wi-Fi

Types of Networks: LAN, WAN, MAN, PAN, WLAN, VPN

Client-Server vs Peer-to-Peer

Exercise: Ask the candidate to explain how their home Wi-Fi works in terms of a “network.”

Session 2: Network Models

OSI Model (7 layers) – explain with examples (Email, Web browsing)

TCP/IP Model – real-world mapping with OSI

Encapsulation/Decapsulation – packet journey from sender to receiver

Exercise: Give an example like “opening google.com” and let them map the layers involved.

Session 3: IP Addressing & Subnetting

IPv4 Basics: Structure, Classes (A, B, C)

Public vs Private vs APIPA vs Loopback

Subnet mask & CIDR notation

Subnetting basics (very simple exercise, e.g., “How many hosts in /29?”)

IPv6 basics – why needed

Exercise: Ask them to find their own IP (ipconfig/ifconfig).

Session 4: Network Devices

Hub, Switch, Router – differences

L2 vs L3 switch

Firewall, Load balancer, IDS/IPS basics

Real-life analogy: Switch = Post office sorter, Router = Traffic police

Exercise: Ask them to explain how a router in their home connects to ISP.

Session 5: Switching Concepts

MAC addresses

VLANs – why needed, VLAN trunking

STP (loop prevention basics)

Port security (preventing rogue devices)

Exercise: Give them a scenario – “Marketing and HR must be on separate VLANs. Why?”

Session 6: Routing Concepts

Routing basics (How routers forward packets)

Static vs Dynamic Routing

Intro to OSPF, RIP, BGP (just awareness)

NAT & PAT with real-life ISP example

Exercise: Ask them why NAT is needed when browsing from home.

Session 7: TCP/IP Protocols

ARP (mapping IP ↔ MAC)

ICMP (ping, traceroute)

DHCP (auto IP assignment)

DNS (website name → IP address)

TCP vs UDP (use cases: HTTP vs VoIP)

Exercise: Use ping google.com and nslookup google.com.

Session 8: Wireless Networking

Wi-Fi Standards (802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax)

SSID, Channels, Interference basics

WPA2 vs WPA3

Exercise: Ask them to find Wi-Fi security type on their laptop/phone.

Session 9: Network Security Basics

ACLs (filtering traffic)

Firewall basics (stateful vs stateless)

VPN (IPSec, SSL VPN – only concepts)

Common attacks: DoS/DDoS, ARP spoofing

Exercise: Ask – “If an attacker floods a server with traffic, what happens?”

Session 10: Network Monitoring & Tools

Tools: ping, traceroute, ipconfig/ifconfig, netstat, nslookup/dig, tcpdump, Wireshark

Logs & monitoring: Syslog, SNMP, NetFlow basics

Exercise: Run traceroute google.com and interpret output.

Session 11: Modern Networking (Cloud/SDN Basics)

SD-WAN & SDN (high-level only)

Load balancing & CDN basics

Cloud Networking (AWS VPC: Subnets, Route Tables, Security Groups)

Exercise: Ask them how AWS VPC is similar to a corporate network.

✅ Final Step

At the end, do a mock Q&A where you ask real-world troubleshooting:

“User cannot access internet but LAN works. What could be the issue?”

“If DNS is down, what happens when you try to open google.com?”

“Two PCs in same VLAN can’t communicate. What will you check?”
