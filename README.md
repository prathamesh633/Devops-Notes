1. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) + Cost Reporting + CI Integration
- What to build: A Terraform-managed infrastructure setup (e.g., multi-tier AWS or Azure) wired into a CI tool. Automate terraform plan with cost estimates for PRs, and terraform apply upon approval.
- Why it stands out: Blends infrastructure-as-code with automation, cost awareness, and governance—all highly valued in production environments.
- Guides: The same Medium article details this as project #9: “Terraform Project with Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline + Cost Reporting” with modular design and PR workflows
